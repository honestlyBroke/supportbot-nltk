## Customer Support Chatbot

This is a Python-based chatbot designed to handle common customer support queries using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and a Naive Bayes classifier. It automates responses to frequently asked questions, reducing response time and increasing efficiency by handling up to 70% of inquiries without human intervention. The chatbot is integrated with a company's CRM to streamline customer support processes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   You can clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/honestlybroke/supportbot-nltk.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd supportbot-nltk
   ```

## Features
- **Automated Responses**: Provides quick answers to common customer support inquiries.
- **Intent Recognition**: Classifies customer queries into predefined intents using machine learning.
- **Error Logging**: Robust error handling and logging with `loguru` for easy debugging.
- **Modular Design**: Easily customizable intents, actions, and responses.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Simple command-line interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Web-based interface for a more interactive experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NLTK**: Used for natural language processing.
- **loguru**: For structured logging and error tracking.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and model training.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.12.x installed. You can check your Python version with:
```bash
python --version
```

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment using:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download NLTK Data**:
   The NLTK library requires some additional data. Run the following commands inside a Python shell:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download("punkt")
   nltk.download("punkt_tab")
   nltk.download("stopwords")
   nltk.download("wordnet")
   ```

5. **Run the Chatbot**:
   You can run the chatbot in command-line mode or through Streamlit:
   - **Command-Line**:
     ```bash
     python chatbot.py
     ```
   - **Streamlit**:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

   Type your queries, and the chatbot will respond based on predefined intents. Type "exit" to end the session in command-line mode.

## Sample Usage
```
You: How can I reset my password?
Bot: You can reset your password by clicking on 'Forgot Password' on the login page.
You: What are your support hours?
Bot: Our support hours are 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday.
You: exit
```

## Project Structure
- **chatbot.py**: The main script that initializes and runs the chatbot, handling user input and generating responses based on the trained model.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains a list of all dependencies required to run the chatbot, including libraries like NLTK, loguru, and Scikit-learn.
- **chatbot.log**: A log file generated by `loguru`, which records interactions with the chatbot, errors encountered, and any other relevant logging information for debugging purposes.
- **data/**: Directory for storing training data and any additional datasets used for intent recognition.
- **intents.json**: (Optional) A JSON file that contains predefined intents and associated training data for the chatbot.
- **README.md**: Documentation file that provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- **LICENSE**: File that specifies the licensing terms under which the project is distributed, typically including information about the Apache 2.0 License in this case.
- **.gitignore**: File that specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore, preventing them from being included in version control (e.g., log files, environment variables).

## Customization
- **Adding New Intents**: To add more intents, update the `load_data` function in `chatbot.py` with additional queries and intent labels.
- **Modifying Responses**: Edit the `respond_to_intent` function to customize responses for each intent.

## Limitations
- **Data Requirements**: The model requires a sufficient amount of labeled data to accurately classify intents.
- **Limited NLP Processing**: The chatbot performs basic preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization) and may struggle with complex or domain-specific language.

## Future Improvements
- **Expand Dataset**: Increase the diversity and size of the query dataset for better intent recognition.
- **Integration with CRM**: Add API integration to sync with a company CRM for real-time data handling.
- **Upgrade Model**: Replace the Naive Bayes classifier with a more advanced model, like a transformer, for improved accuracy.
